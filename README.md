# PONG
##  Synopsis
#### I am sure that we all have played PONG before. PONG is a game that was very popular before these console games came out. I remember playing PONG when I was 6 years old. 


#### I am bulding a game that should be fairly simple. There is gonna be two posts that will try to hit the ball before it goes off screen. 


#### if the ball goes off screen it's a point for the other player. First to __FIVE__ points wins the game.

## My Approach
#### I started by laying out what I want the game to do first. And then I started to write the code and seeing if it worked live on the web. After I was about halfway done with the game, I figured that I had over two hundred lines of code, which made it hard to navigate when I was debugging. I then created a another folder for functions. Doing so made reading the code and navigating so much easier. 

## MVP
* Have a winner box at the bottom
* Have a score counter 
* Render a ball when someone scores a point
* Have a reset button for when someone wins
* Find a way for two people to play at the same time

## Stretch Goals
* Have the opposing post go up and down at a consitant speed
* Make levels of hardness
* Get the balls increse in numbers
* get an impossible to beat AI
* Have the ball move up in speed that makes sense; for example when someone gets to 4 points, have the ball going at a very fast speed

## Tech Being Used
* Html/CSS
* JavaScript
* HTML5 Canvas

## potential Roadblocks
* Finding a way to end the game after the score reaches 6
* Getting the ball to render back into the game after someone scores
* Getting the ball to go faster depanding on the score
* Finding a way to make the ball bounce
* collision and point scoring

## Post-Project Reflection and unsolved probloms or growth areas
#### This project was a lot more challenging than I anticipated. I thought that it would be easier to have the post go up and down on a set timer. I also would have loved to make levels that could increse speed of either the ball or make the post slower. The thing I regret the most is not having an AI to beat. Hopefully I will do it sometime in the future.
