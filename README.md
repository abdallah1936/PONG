# PONG
##  I am sure that we all have played PONG before.
#### PONG is a game that was very popular before these console games came out. I remember playing PONG when I was 6 years old. 


#### I am bulding a game that should be fairly simple. There is gonna be two posts that will try to hit the ball before it goes off screen. 


#### if the ball goes off screen it's a point for the other player. First to __FIVE__ points wins the game.
